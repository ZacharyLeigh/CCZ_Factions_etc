# Pítati: A related term used in cuneiform texts to describe Nubian archers serving in Egyptian forces.
# These elite bowmen were often deployed to defend Egyptian vassals in Canaan during the New Kingdom period.

# Libyan Skirmishers
# Libyan skirmishers were not heavy infantry or chariot warriors like the Egyptians. Instead, they specialized in:

# 1. Hit-and-Run Tactics
# They avoided direct confrontation with Egyptian forces.
# Preferred ambushes, raids, and quick withdrawals.
# Used terrain to their advantage, especially desert and border zones.

# 2. Light Armor and Mobility
# Fought with minimal armor, allowing for speed and agility.
# Often wore leather or linen garments, with distinctive feathered headdresses.

# 3. Weapons
# Throwing spears and javelins: Ideal for skirmishing and keeping distance.
# Short swords or daggers: Used in close combat when necessary.
# Bows: Some Libyan groups were skilled archers, though not as renowned as Nubians.

# 4. Psychological Warfare
# Their unpredictable movements and sudden attacks created fear and confusion.
# Egyptians built fortresses along the western frontier to monitor and repel Libyan incursions
# What were the Libyan warriors called?
#
# Egyptian records refer to Libyan warriors generically as “Libu” or “Meshwesh”, which were tribal names rather than military ranks.
# These warriors were often depicted with feathered headdresses, javelins, and round shields, indicating their role as light infantry or skirmishers
# In later periods, especially during Libyan rule in Egypt (Third Intermediate Period), Libyan-descended rulers adopted Egyptian titles like “Great Chief of the Ma” (wr n MA), where Ma referred to a Libyan tribal confederation.

# Egyptian Military
# Weapons
    # Mace, spear, bow, Axe (crescent shaped), Khopesh (curved sword resembling sickle), dagger
# Early Armor
    # Minimal armor (linen kilts or leather aprons)
    # Shields made of wood and leather, often round or rectangular
# Late Armor
    # Scale armor of bronze and leather
# Chariots pulled by two horses, carried a driver and an archer

# Shock troops:
# Known in Egyptian as “mighty ones of the king” (nekhtyu n nesu), they were handpicked soldiers who had proven themselves in battle.
# Armour
#   Scale armor: Made from bronze or hardened leather, offering protection without sacrificing mobility.
#   Decorated shields: Often larger and reinforced, possibly bearing royal insignia.
#   Helmets or headdresses: While not always worn in battle, ceremonial gear included ornate headpieces

# Sherden Pirates
# They were a group of sea-roving marauders on the Mediterranean coast during the New Kingdom (1550-1070 B. C. E.). In the Nineteenth Dynasty, they began raiding the Egyptian Delta. A stela from TANIS stated: “none were able to stand before them.” RAMESSES III (r. 1194-1163 B. C. E.) defeated the Sherden Pirates and incorporated them into his military forces. Carrying round shields and large swords, some of these buccaneers became Ramesses III’s personal guards. They received land grants in repayment. Rameses II (r. 1290-1224 B. C. E.) also fought the Sherden Pirates. Invasion of the Sea Peoples - War History
# They wore kilts and headdresses of feathers or pleated stiffened cloths and they carried spears, short swords, and round shields. The Great HARRIS PAPYRUS adds other details

# Egyptian Cultist


    # >> Sobek Servant         >> Rivergaurd
    # This male unit will wear a crocodile head, and become a crocodile animorph at level 3
    # This line will do well in the water, and get shallow water ambush.
    # Will have great pierce and blade resistance
    # Will weild a bowstaff, and Bite, with the last one have a deathroll
    # Associate with granting power and virility, so damage aura
#                      >> Bast Servant          >> Bast Nightprowler
    # female with cat head, becomes a panther
    # Associated with nuturing and protection, so give her anti-damage aura
# Apothacary           >> Embalmber             >> Priest of Anubis   >> Emissary of Osiris



# The High Kingdom
# This faction is going to be heavy offense, with very poor defense, with poor resistances, health, and terrain preferences to be more like the orcs, without the 60% in the mountains or the 50% in the forest, and some units doing better in shallow water than most. Get %50 in sand and desert
    # Exceptions will be the Kings braves, the pirates, and the Libyan skirmishers, and then the magical units may get bonuses as well
    # Probably similar health to elves, except the higher level magic units, and the charioteers should have a lot of health
# What are we thinking for their resistances?
    # arcane resist
    # Minor fire resist
    # Less pierce weakness for chariots than normal horses
    # Weak to pierce
    # Weak to blade
    # Minor weak to cold (actually no, because the Eastern deserts get really cold at night)
    # Units with shields get resistance to blade?
    # Level 1 units have no armor, level 2 and above get scale armor
        # The scale armor improves their resistances
# Unique chariot features
    # Greatest movement of any unit, can’t go on mountains, rivers, swamps, 4 movement in caves, 3 movement in forest, snow, and ice
    # Unique hit and run that combines all attack into 1 for both sides and grants first strike to the charioteer. Also gets any remaining movement back after the attack (might be tricky with zones of control)
# Archers can advance into charioteers, as well as soldiers
# Skirmishers get hit and run, and maybe desert ambush
